## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process
I unfortunely did not use a mobile first approach with this project because I need to continue to improve on working with media queries and become more comfortable with the mobile first approach.
I started off with the simple things such as creating the footer and updating the links then changing the background color to match the design. Next, I split the content up into 3 divs(main, image, content). Then I put the content of each div inside it with different tags and classes to seperate the elements. I was going back and forth with styling and worked on styling the elements throughout the whole process rather than leaving it all to the end. I did the media queries for mobile screen size last. Added the finishing touches and went on to deploy.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got to practice media queries a bit in this project. I also got to practice using different CSS methods to position objects such as flexbox, grid and tables.

### Continued development

The main container contains 2 sub containers, the image container and the content container. The content container is slightly longer than the image container and they should be flush with eachother.
I attempted to fix this but was unsuccessful. I am looking forward to getting feedback on frontend mentor so that I can fix this issue along with anything else that is brought to my attention.
